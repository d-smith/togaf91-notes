# TOGAF 9.1 Level 1 Certification

## TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework

An architecture framework is:

1. A precisely defined language for defining an architecture
2. Predefined building blocks for putting it together
3. The precise steps to follow

The exams

* Part 1 - Understanding of the TOGAF 9.1 spec. Done in person, 40 multiple
choice questions, must get 22/40 to pass.
* Part 2 - Applying TOGAF to several scenarios

Exam 1 Breakdown

* Basic concepts (3 questions)
* Core concepts (3)
* Intro to the ADM (3)
* Enterprise continuum and tools (4)
* ADM Phases (9)
* ADM Guidelines and Techniques (6)
* Architecture governance (4)
* Architecture views, viewpoints, stakeholders (2)
* Building blocks (2)
* ADM Deliverables (2)
* TOGAF reference model (2)

## Intro to Basic and Core Concepts

Architecture Framework

* Set of definitions
* Specific set of steps
* Content meta model

Definitions

*Enterprise* - Any collections of organizations that have a common set of goals

*Architecture*

1. A formal description of a system to guide implementation
2. The structure of components, their interrlationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.

Purpose

* The purpose of enterprise architecture is to optimize across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes (both manual and automated) into an integrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.

Why Do We Need an Enterprise Architecture?

* All enterprises have legacy systems
* Often no single documement covers all of them
* No single person can explain how everything works
* No plan for how to add new systems going forward
* Surprises when trying to make big changes
* Large amounts of technical debt

Benefits

* Lower cost because you are able to be more responsive to change (dev, maint, support)
* Reduced complexity
* Reduced risk
* Simpler to add new systems
* Faster purchase and implementation

Business Benefits (from the spec)

* A more efficient business operation
* A more efficient IT operation
* Better return on existing investment
* Faster, simpler, and cheaper procurement

What is an Architecture Framework?

* Common vocabulary
* A set of tools or building blocks
* A methodology for designing a target state of the architecture
* A set of recommended standards

Four Architecture Domains (BDAT)

* Business - strategy, governance, organization, key business processes
* Data - structure of the logical and physical data assets, data management
* Application - blueprint for individual applications, interactions, relationships to
core business processes
* Technology (IT) - logical hardware and software capabilities to support the above
(hardware, networks, etc)

Architecture Development Method

* Heart of the TOGAF
* Method by which an architecture is designed
* 9 phases plus requirements management
* Interative process
* Type type of architecture are focused on - baseline and target

Core Concepts - Deliverables, Artifacts, Building Blocks

*Deliverable* - work product contractually specified, formally reviewed, agreed to,
and signed off on by stakeholders. Outputs of project.

*Artifact* - architectural work products, catalogs, diagrams, matrices, etc placed
into an architecture repository.

*Building Block* -  a potentially reusable component (architecture building blocks,
solution building blocks)

Core Concept - Enterprise Continuum

* Line along which to classiffy how generic or specific to your organization a solution is
* A view of the architecture repository
* Most generic on the left, most specific on the right

Continuum Classifications

* Foundation architecture - generic
* Common Systems Architecture - more specific, layered onto the foundation, applies
very broadly
* Industry - specific to an industry
* Organization - specific architecture

Core Concept - Architecture Repository

* The place where architecture outputs are stored (artifacts, deliverables, views, etc)
* Supports the enterprise continuum
* Different architecture outputs at different levels of abstractioj

Components in the repository

* Architecture metamodel (templates)
* Architecture capability (your assessment of your architecture group)
* Architecture landscape (baseline and target architectures)
* Standards information base
* Reference library (external ref models)
* Governance log

Core Concept - Architecture Capability of the Org

* The capability of an organiation to support an architecture function
* Full time architecture group, who they report to, governance board
* Will everyone follow the rules? How do you ensure this?
* Roles and responsibilities
* Skills and knowledge (processes too?)
