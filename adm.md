#Architecture Development Method

Interative, per phase and over the lifetime of the architecture

##What is the ADM?

Architecture Development Method

* A method for developing and managing the life cycle of an enterprise architecture

Nine phases

* Preliminary (done once)
* Eight in a cycles, requirements managment at the core interacting with all phases
* All phases have inputs, steps, outputs

Preliminary Phase

* Preperation and initiation activities
* Defining the enterprise
	* Which lines of busines
	* Which applications
	* Which customer channels
	* Which outside partners are to be considered part of the enterprise

* Choosing frameworks
	* TOGAF for arch, ITIL for implementation and service mgmt, industry frameworks, etc.
* Evaluate enterprise maturity and capability
* Define architecture principles

Architecture Vision - Phase A

* Problems defined, solutions to be delivered
* Develop a high level vision to be delivered
* Obtain approval for the statement of architecture work
	* Scope, estimate resources required, develop a roadmap and schedule
	* Define KPIs and metrics
* Developer a communications plan

Business Architeture - Phase B

* The B in BDAT
* Develop a baseline business architecture v1.0 - current state, developed bottom-up
* Develop a target business architecture v1.0 - top down
* Identify gaps between baseline, target

Information System Architecture - Phase C

* The D and A in BDAT
* Data and applications done separately
* Develop baseline data architecture v1.0
* Develop target data architecture v1.0
* Develop baseline application architecture 1.0
* Develop target app architecture 1.0


Technology Architecture

* T in BDAT
* Same story - baseline and target, gap analysis
